# Linux Message Queues CLI Utilities

Welcome to the Linux Message Queues CLI Utilities repository! Elevate your inter-process communication game with this collection of command-line tools implemented in C, designed to seamlessly create, send, and receive messages using message queues in the Linux operating system.

## Why Message Queues in Linux?

Unlock the potential of efficient data exchange between processes using the powerful `msgget()` system call. Dive into the world of key features:

- **Key Generation:** Leverage the `key_t` parameter, generated with `IPC_PRIVATE` or `ftok()`, as a unique identifier for your message queues.

- **Permission Bits:** Tailor your queue with the `msgflag` parameter, specifying permission bits, including options like `IPC_CREAT` for creating a new queue and `IPC_EXCL` for exclusive creation.

- **Dynamic Communication:** Facilitate structured communication between processes with message queues, providing an elegant solution for sending and receiving messages.
